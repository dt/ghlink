# Link Github Issues

Link to mentioned issues (and pull requests) on Github.

## Features

Links any `user/repo#issue` to the issue (or pull request) on Github.

Additionally, if the workspace root contains a `.git/config` that mentions
a github.com remote, then it will also link plain issue and pull request numbers
(e.g. "fixed in #123") to that issue in that repository.
